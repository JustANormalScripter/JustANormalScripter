Here is an elongated version of my bio:
Hello! My name is Salmontree, I am currently working on a project with my friend on the platform Roblox, the game is a tower defense game based off of the currently popular (As of 2025) game Dead Rails, the game is not gonna be anything like it and will most likely be done by 2026, christmas time. Me and im want to perfect it for the maybe upcoming people who want to try it out! This GitHub profile is mainly for any of these things;
School unblocking bookmarklets
My Roblox game probabilities
My Roblox exploit scripts (yes ik)
Reposted stuff from my old GitHub
Any websites I make.
Any PolyTrack maps I have edited or made (Will work on those selenite websites for the people who love unblocked PolyTrack)
Unblocked websites I find.
All of these things will obviously be separated into different repositories (I think that's what it's called), so it isn't just a cluttered mess of junk.
This is the end of the full bio. Thank you for spending time reading this!
